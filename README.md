# Overview: E-Commerce Data Engineering Initiative  

Introducing my new project, the **E-commerce Data Engineering Project**, which seeks to provide solutions to some of the most important business problems: **Customer Churn Prediction**, **RFM Segmentation**, and developing high-end **data visualization tools**.  

---

## Project Vision and Objectives  

This project is purposed to design and implement a holistic end-to-end **E-commerce Data Pipeline**. The objective is to transform raw data into actionable insights that drive better business decisions and strategic planning.  

The centerpiece will be an interactive **Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard**, supported by predictive analytics, which enables the discovery of customer behaviors in terms of churn risk and purchasing patterns through RFM analysis.  

The architecture of the project is modular, with clear pipelines for **data ingestion**, **batch processing**, **real-time stream processing**, and **visualization**. The streaming framework is inspired by Emma Tang's enlightening presentation on building batch data pipelines using Airflow, Spark, and EMR at the 2018 Big Data Conference in Vilnius.

## Business Use Cases and Analytical Visualizations  

The output of this data pipeline will be designed to meet two basic business needs:  

1. **Business Use Cases**:  
   Quantifiable value, such as using machine learning models to generate predictive insights that can be used to optimize pricing for maximum profitability.  

2. **Data Visualizations**:  
   Indirect value by way of interactive dashboards and BI platforms that support deeper analysis of cause-and-effect relationships in business operations.  

For this project, I have chosen two very important E-commerce applications:  
- **Customer Churn Prediction**  
- **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Segmentation**  

---

### RFM Segmentation  

RFM segmentation segments customers based on their purchasing habits to enable businesses to create effective marketing strategies. High-value customers ("Champions") may be targeted with special promotions for maximum loyalty.  

Scores assigned to each of the three important dimensions - **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary Value** - may follow simple threshold-based rule-based approaches or a more sophisticated one using unsupervised clustering algorithms like **K-Means**.  

Implementation strategies are taken up in the next posting as part of describing the **Stream Processing Pipeline** in greater detail.

### Customer Churn Prediction  

Customer churn analysis identifies people who are in danger of leaving a business. Sometimes, retaining a customer is five times cheaper than attracting new ones, which evidences the strategic importance of the analysis.  

A machine learning model using **logistic regression** will evaluate customer behavior and provide a churn probability score. This allows for effective retention strategies for those customers whose risk score exceeds a predefined threshold and also determines key drivers of churning.  

---

## Advanced Data Visualization  

Data visualization plays an important role in strategic decision-making as it offers a clear vision into the performance of an organization.  

I will build a dynamic **Product Sales Dashboard**. It will highlight key metrics like:  
- **Bestsellers and Trending Products**  
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**  
- **Revenue and Transaction Volumes**  

These visualizations will provide the ability for business stakeholders to track their performance indicators and take remedial measures if there is any deviation from the expected outcome.  

---

## Dataset Selection  

Given the requirements of the project, I select a dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** that has transactional data representing 2010-2011. It is of a relatively small size (~43.47 MB), which keeps cloud computing costs low while being deep enough in insights of significant analytical value.  

---

## Pipeline Architecture  

The architecture of the pipeline has been broadly segregated into four major components for efficient modular development and scalability:  

1. **Data Ingestion Pipeline**  
2. **Batch Processing Pipeline**  
3. **Stream Processing Pipeline**  
4. **Visualization Pipeline**  

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** was chosen because of its strength in providing tools that are industry-standard and scalable as well.  

---

### Ingestion Pipeline  

It is responsible for extracting the source data in raw format in `.csv` into AWS. REST APIs and custom scripts are put in place to trigger the upload.  

---

### Batch Processing Pipeline  

This pipeline is designed to execute at periodic intervals. The processes within this pipeline operate in parallel, executing large datasets in batches to maximize performance. In this case, it produces the enriched feature tables for customer churn analytics, which can be done daily as it's not time-critical.  

---

### Stream Processing Pipeline  

The real-time processing pipeline constructs dynamic feature tables like **RFM scores** that help in time-sensitive operations such as customer segmentation for targeted campaigns.  

---

### Visualization Pipeline  

The whole chain of transactional raw data transformation into the denormalized OLAP-friendly format is to be integrated within the BI to allow for low-latency analytics and real-time visualization.  

---

## Finalized Data Pipeline  

Modular structuring, as explained in the book *Andreas Kretz's Data Engineering Cookbook*, allows for flexibility with iterations in enhancement or improvement as time progresses.

## Next Steps  

Future work will include a detailed comparison of AWS-provided tools (e.g., **Kinesis**) versus open-source options (e.g., **Kafka**) as well as building the ingestion pipeline. Detailed updates will be provided on my GitHub repository, and a demo video will be shared at the end.

## Tools and Frameworks  

Following is an overview of technologies used in this project:  

- **AWS Lambda**: A serverless compute service used for lightweight, event-driven transformations.  
- **AWS API Gateway**: Provides a fully managed service for APIs to transfer data.  
- **AWS Kinesis**: Real-time Data Streaming Service for handling data flow efficiently.  
- **Apache Airflow**: A Python-based orchestration tool that helps in managing ETL jobs sequentially.  
- **Apache Spark**: A unified, distributed processing framework for both batch and streaming workloads.  
- **AWS DynamoDB**: Highly available and scalable NoSQL database for Key-Value storage.  
- **AWS Redshift**: Columnar data warehouse for low-latency queries.  
- **AWS S3**: Scalable object storage for distributed data processing.  
- **Power BI**: A versatile BI platform to create interactive dashboards.

This project is a stepping stone toward mastering the intersection of **data engineering** and **business intelligence**. Stay tuned for more updates as I refine the pipeline and share insights along the way.
